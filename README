NAME
    RDF::vCard::Babelfish - convert between myriad contact formats

SYNOPSIS
      use RDF::vCard::Babelfish;
      my $babelfish = RDF::vCard::Babelfish->new('HCARD' => 'VCARDXML');
      print $babelfish->convert($input_string);

QUOTES
    "And the Lord descended, and we descended with him to see the city and
    the tower which the children of men had built. And he confounded their
    language, and they no longer understood one another's speech, and they
    ceased then to build the city and the tower." *Jubilees 10:23-24*

    "The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in
    your ear you can instantly understand anything in any form of language."
    *Hitchhikers 6*

    "Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so
    mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some
    thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the
    non-existence of God." *Hitchhikers 6*

DESCRIPTION
    This is a sort of supplementary module to go with RDF::vCard. It adds
    some cool functionality at the cost of a few additional dependencies.
    It's a simple way to convert between the following formats:

      HCARD         input only
      JCARD         output only
      NTRIPLES
      RDFA
      RDFJSON
      RDFXML
      TURTLE
      VCARD3
      VCARD4
      VCARDXML      output only

    For the RDF-based formats, the W3C vCard vocabulary, as described in
    RDF::vCard::Exporter is expected.

    Some conversions are slightly lossy, but overall, even when chaining
    several conversions together, results are fairly good.

TODO
    Nice to have: jCard and vCardXML input; Portable Contacts.
